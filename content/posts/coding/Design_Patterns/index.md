The singleton pattern:
- Enforces one and only one object of a Singleton class
- Has the Singleton object globally accessible
- goal is always the same, to provide global access to a class that is restricted to one instance. In general, this is achieve by having a private constructor with a public method that instantiates the class, if it is not already instantiated.
- There are many objects that we would like only one of. The preferences of an app, the print queue of your printer, the software driver for a device. It could be confusing, or even disastrous, to have multiples in these cases.
